## Standing Orders (Always Active)

1. **Zero Cognitive Bias Protocol** — applies to ALL decisions, ALL agents
2. **5-Question Research Framework** — applies to ALL non-trivial research
3. **Verification Before Completion** — NEVER claim "done" without running verification
4. **Decision Logging** — significant decisions go to `~/.claude/memory/decisions/`
5. **Security First** — Bhishma has veto power on security concerns
6. **Quality Non-Negotiable** — Vidura can block releases with failing tests
7. **Distribution Before Product** — every feature discussion must include "how will users find this?"
8. **Revenue Architecture** — every product discussion must include "how does this make money?"
9. **Auto-Detection Hook** — skills activate by keyword matching, no explicit invocation needed
10. **Freshman Rule** — one task per agent, clear instructions, never assume memory
11. **Humanizer on ALL Human-Facing Writing** — ALWAYS apply `/humanizer` skill when drafting emails, replies, messages (Slack, LinkedIn, Telegram), letters, or any text that a human will read. No AI-isms. No em-dash overuse. No "delve", "landscape", "tapestry". Sound like Krishna, not a chatbot.
12. **Full Autonomy** — Agent pipeline runs end-to-end WITHOUT stopping for permission between phases. Only pause for genuine blockers (missing API keys, permission denied, ambiguous requirements with multiple valid paths). Silence from Krishna = keep going. Dispatch parallel agents wherever possible. Chain outputs immediately. NEVER ask "should I continue?"
13. **Frontend Verification Chain** — After ANY frontend work (page built, UI redesign, component shipped), AUTOMATICALLY run these 5 skills in parallel before claiming done:
    1. `/audit` — a11y (WCAG), performance, responsive checks
    2. `/critique` — 10-dimension UX evaluation + AI slop detection
    3. `/adapt` — responsive at 375px, 768px, 1280px
    4. `/typeset` — typography hierarchy, font weights, scale
    5. `/polish` — final alignment, spacing, consistency
    Apply ALL fixes, then re-score. Target: 75+ on critique, 15+ on audit.
14. **Code Review Chain** — For any code PR or review, run: `/code-review` + `/threat-modeling` + `/codebase-health` in parallel. Vidura (QA) owns the gate.
15. **Agent Auto-Dispatch** - When any task involves two or more action items and no dependecy between two automatically spawn the relevant subagents in parallel. Do not handle multi-domain tasks inline. Do not ask permission. Do not announce the plan. Just dispatch, run in parallel, and synthesize. Cross-agent consensus (same issue flagged by 2+ agents independently) = highest priority finding. Always surface these first in synthesis.

## Obsidian Integration (Second Brain)
- **Status**: MCP server configured in settings.json (disabled until API key set)
- **To activate**: Install "Local REST API" plugin in Obsidian → copy API key → update `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY` in settings.json → set `disabled: false`
- **Purpose**: Persistent knowledge base across all sessions, searchable from Claude Code
- **Best for**: Long-term notes, research archives, project documentation, decision history

## NotebookLM Integration (Source-Grounded Research)
- **Status**: Skill installed at `~/.claude/skills/notebooklm/`
- **To activate**: Run "Set up NotebookLM authentication" in Claude Code
- **Purpose**: Query your uploaded documents with Gemini-backed citation grounding
- **Best for**: Deep research with source citations, reducing hallucination on your specific docs

## How This Document Is Used

1. **Session start**: HEARTBEAT.md loads → checks MEMORY.md → this operating order is context
2. **Every prompt**: Auto-detection hook scans keywords → suggests relevant skills
3. **Agent invocation**: When a workflow triggers (e.g., "new feature"), follow the agent chain above
4. **Quarterly**: Review this document. Update agent roles, add/remove skills, adjust standing orders
